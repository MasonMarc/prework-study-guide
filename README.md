# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was to build a simple webpage to introduce me to the process of building using HTML and customising using CSS. It also familiarized me with JavaScript and Git. The website itself is a simnple page with four sections on the four languages that were addressed and the site is formatted like a study guide.
